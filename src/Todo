make UI - use swing/jframe or javafx
import first nations bc data (i/o?) data integration
add pictures of each community
use musqueam online interactive map for inspiration
    - landmarks for a specific community - maybe tie in with FNEL 141 class! (do it about that community)
add sounds/pronunciation of words

birth and death methods are not working
    probably because most recent is not working
        maybe because most recent is creating a new object and not actually working on the original object
    an idea is to show the list of communities already made and to pick one from the list and work on that one

make birth and death abstraction in community

make it if else
use cons instead of if or "cases"

given valid zipcode, plot them on a map

add search

    //TODO 9/26/18
        //attempt at setup (maybe make a superclass) - so
        //make new class called "setUpGUI"
        //and Menu extends setUpGUI and AddCommunity extends setUpGUI
